# scrapbook-customizer (WIP)
 
To use, just open up index.html or go to [https://jasonappah.github.io/scrapbook-customizer](https://jasonappah.github.io/scrapbook-customizer)! ~For now, images and other media don't show up properly, but that'll hopefully be fixed soon.~ Fixed that but now the CSS won't apply to the page \*sigh\*.
